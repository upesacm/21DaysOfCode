Binary Search

Problem Introduction
In this problem, you will implement the binary search algorithm that allows searching
very efficiently (even huge) lists, provided that the list is sorted.

Problem Description
Task. The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛 and a sequence 𝑎0 < 𝑎1 < . . . < 𝑎𝑛−1
of 𝑛 pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. The next line contains an integer 𝑘 and 𝑘
positive integers 𝑏0, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑘−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 105; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 3 · 104; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛; 1 ≤ 𝑏𝑗 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑗 < 𝑘;

Output Format. For all 𝑖 from 0 to 𝑘 − 1, output an index 0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 such that 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑏𝑖 or −1 if there
is no such index.

Sample 1.
Input:
5 1 5 8 12 13
5 8 1 23 1 11
Output:
2 0 -1 0 -1
In this sample, we are given an increasing sequence 𝑎0 = 1, 𝑎1 = 5, 𝑎2 = 8, 𝑎3 = 12, 𝑎4 = 13 of length
five and five keys to search: 8, 1, 23, 1, 11. We see that 𝑎2 = 8 and 𝑎0 = 1, but the keys 23 and 11 do
not appear in the sequence 𝑎. For this reason, we output a sequence 2, 0,−1, 0,−1.
