You are given an array A. The diversity of the array A is defined as number of pairs i,j,i<j such that Ai≠Aj.

You want to maximize the diversity of the array. For that, you are allowed to make at most K operations on it, in any of which, you can select a particular element and change its value to any integer in the range 1 to 109, both inclusive.

Find out the maximum diversity of the array that you can obtain.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers N,K. where N denotes the length of array A.
The next line of each testcase contains N space separated integers, the i-th of which denotes Ai.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line, the answer corresponding to the testcase, which should be an integer denoting the maximum possible diversity.
