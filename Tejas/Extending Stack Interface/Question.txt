Extending stack interface

Problem Introduction
Stack is an abstract data type supporting the operations Push() and Pop(). It is not difficult to implement
it in a way that both these operations work in constant time. In this problem, you goal will be to implement
a stack that also supports finding the maximum value and to ensure that all operations still work in constant
time.

Problem Description
Task. Implement a stack supporting the operations Push(), Pop(), and Max().
Input Format. The first line of the input contains the number 𝑞 of queries. Each of the following 𝑞 lines
specifies a query of one of the following formats: push v, pop, or max.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑞 ≤ 400 000, 0 ≤ 𝑣 ≤ 105.
Output Format. For each max query, output (on a separate line) the maximum value of the stack.

Sample 1.
Input:
5
push 2
push 1
max
pop
max
Output:
2
2
Explanation:
After the first two push queries, the stack contains elements 1 and 2. After the pop query, the element
1 is removed.


Sample 2.
Input:
5
push 1
push 2
max
pop
max
Output:
2
1

Sample 3.
Input:
10
push 2
push 3
push 9
push 7
push 2
max
max
max
pop
max
Output:
9
9
9
9
