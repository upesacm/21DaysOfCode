You are given two integers l and r.
You have to choose k real numbers in the interval [l,r] uniform randomly.
What is the expected count of distinct numbers chosen by you?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers l, r and k.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the expected count of distinct numbers chosen. It can be proved that the expected count is always an integer.

Constraints
1=T=105
1=k=100
1=l=r=100
Example Input
3
3 6 4
1 3 1
6 7 2
Example Output
4
1
2
Explanation
Example case 2: You choose only 1 real number, so it doesn't matter which real number you chose, number of distinct number is always 1. So expected count of distinct number is 1.
