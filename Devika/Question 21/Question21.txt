Multilevel Inheritance-Hackerrank



In the previous problem we learned about Inheritance and how can a derived class object use the member functions of the base class.

In this we will see what multi-level inheritance is. Suppose we have a class A which is the base class and we have a class B which is derived from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access the functions of both class A and class B by creating an object for class C. This is called Multi-Level inheritance. (B inherits A and C inherits B.)

Now create a class called Equilateral which inherits from Isosceles and should have a function such that the output is as given below.

Sample Output
I am an equilateral triangle
I am an isosceles triangle
I am a triangle
