Left Rotation


A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array[1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become[3,4,5,1,2] .

Given an array of n integers and a number, d , perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of left rotations you must perform).
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

Output Format
Print a single line of  space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing  left rotations.

Sample Input
5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output
5 1 2 3 4
