You are given an array A of N integers. Now, two functions  and  are defined:

 : This is the smallest number Z such that  and 

 : This is the smallest number Z such that  and 

Now, you need to find for each index i of this array , where  . If such a number does not exist, for a particular index i, output 1 as its answer. If such a number does exist, output 

Input :

The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A. Each of the next N lines contains a single integer, where the integer on the  line denotes .

Output :

Print N space separated integers on a single line, where the  integer denotes  or 1, if  does not exist.
