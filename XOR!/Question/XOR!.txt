"I have only one rule, never submit partially correct code" -Barney Stinson

The religious act which Barney and his friends hold most sacred, XORING the natural numbers in the given range. This time Barney is a bit busy with picking up some girls, so he asked you to help him. He gave you two numbers L and R, you have to find if XOR of all the numbers in range L to R (L,R both inclusive) is odd or even.

Warning!! Large Input-Output. Please use Fast IO.

Input:
The first line will contain T, number of testcases.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, two integers L,R.
Output:
For each testcase, in the new line print "Odd" if the XOR in the range is odd, else print "Even".

Constraints
1=T=106
1=L=R=1018
Sample Input:
    4 
    1 4
    2 6
    3 3
    2 3
Sample Output:
    Even
    Even
    Odd
    Odd
EXPLANATION:
Test case -1 -> XOR (1,2,3,4) =4

Test case -2 -> XOR (2,3,4,5,6) =6

Test case -3 -> XOR (3) =3

Test case -4 -> XOR (2,3) =1
