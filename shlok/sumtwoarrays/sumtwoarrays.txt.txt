Write a program to add the corresponding elements of two arrays, each of size N and print the sums. N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 

Instructions:

We have defined an integer variable N for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
We have defined integer arrays numArray1[N],numArray2[N]  and
sumArray[N]
 .
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the array elements.
Store the sum values in respective elements of variable
sumArray[N] 
Print all the elements of sumArray with space between them
Sample Input:
N = 3
numArrayA= 3 9 8
numArrayB= 8 12 74

Sample Output:
11 21 82
