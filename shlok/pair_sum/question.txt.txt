Given a random integer array "ARR" and a number "X". Find and print the pair of elements in the array which sum to "X".
Given array can contain duplicate elements as well.
While printing a pair, print the smaller element first.
That is, if a valid pair is (6, 5) print "5 6". There is no constraint that out of 5 pairs which have to be printed in 1st line. You can print pairs in any order, just be careful about the order of elements in a pair.
Input format :
Line 1 : Integer N (Array size)
Line 2 : Elements of the Array separated by single space
Line 3 : Integer X
Output format :
Line 1 : Pair 1 - Elements separated by a single space
Line 2 : Pair 2 - Elements separated by a single space
Line 3 : and so on
Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^4
0 <= x <= 100
Sample Input 1:
9
1 3 6 2 5 4 3 2 4
7
Sample Output 1:
1 6
3 4
3 4
2 5
2 5
3 4
3 4
Sample Input 2:
9
1 3 6 2 5 4 3 2 4
12
Sample Output 2:


 Explanation for Input 2:
Since there doesn't exist any pair with sum equal to 12, nothing got printed.
