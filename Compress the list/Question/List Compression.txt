You are given a strictly increasing sequence of integers A1,A2,…,AN. Your task is to compress this sequence.

The compressed form of this sequence is a sequence of ranges separated by commas (characters ','). A range is either an integer or a pair of integers separated by three dots (the string "..."). When each range a...b in the compressed form is decompressed into the subsequence (a,a+1,…,b), we should obtain the (comma-separated) sequence A again.

For each maximal contiguous subsequence (a,a+1,…,b) of A such that b=a+2, the compressed form of A must contain the range a...b; if b=a+1, such a sequence should not be compressed into a range. A contiguous subsequence is maximal if it cannot be extended by at least one element of A next to it. It can be proved that the compressed form of any sequence is unique (i.e. well-defined).

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one string ? the compressed form of the given sequence.

Constraints
1=T=100
1=N=100
1=Ai=1,000 for each valid i

Example Output
1...3,5,6,8...12,15,17
4,5,7,8
4
Explanation
Example case 1:

(1,2,3) is a contiguous subsequence with length 3, so it is replaced by the string "1...3"
(5,6) is a contiguous subsequence, but only with length 2, so it is not compressed into a range
(8,9,10,11,12) is a contiguous subsequence with length 5, so it is replaced by "8...12"
the elements 15, 17 are unaffected
