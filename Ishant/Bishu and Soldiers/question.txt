Bishu went to fight for Coding Club. There were N soldiers with various powers. There will be Q rounds to fight and in each round Bishu's power will be varied. With power M, Bishu can kill all the soldiers whose power is less than or equal to M(<=M). After each round, All the soldiers who are dead in previous round will reborn.Such that in each round there will be N soldiers to fight. As Bishu is weak in mathematics, help him to count the number of soldiers that he can kill in each round and total sum of their powers.

1<=N<=10000

1<=power of each soldier<=100

1<=Q<=10000

1<=power of bishu<=100
